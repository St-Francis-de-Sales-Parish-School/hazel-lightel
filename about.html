    <h1> About Me!</h1>
      <p>My name is Hazel and I am 11 years old. My favorite subject is math, but I also really like art. My favorite color is pink, my favorite food is chicken and my absolute favorite dessert is ice cream. I have 4 older siblings: 3 sisters and a brother. I have a dog and her name is Frankie and I have 2 outdoor cats named Max and Marshall. I play 3 sports: Softball, Volleyball, and Basketball. My favorite sport is volleyball but I have played softball the longest. My favorite holiday is Christmas because I get many gifts, I get to eat delicous food, and I get to spend time with my family, but it's also my favorite holiday because we get to celibrate the Lord's birthday.</p>
